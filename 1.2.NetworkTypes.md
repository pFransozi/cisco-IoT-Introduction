# IoT Introduction

## Digital Transformation

### Network Types

Modern networks can be a bit confusing. There are many types that are characterized by their geographic size, by the number of devices or networks that they connect, and by whether they support mobile devices or not. Networks can also be characterized by their function and purpose.

#### Personal Area Network (PAN)

Personal area networks are small networks where connected wireless devices are within personal reach. Connecting your smartphone to your car using Bluetooth is an example of a PAN.

##### Local Area Network (LAN)

LANs are typically networks in a small or local geographic area, such as a home, small business or department within a large corporation. LANs can connect two or more devices, including computers, printers, and wireless devices. LANs provide access to larger wide area networks (WANs) and the Internet.

#### Wide Area Networks (WANs)

The term WAN typically refers to a collection of LANs that provides inter-LAN and Internet connectivity for businesses and governments.

**The Internet** is a multi-layer global network system that connects hundreds of millions of computers. The Internet is not owned by any one person or organization. This large system is comprised of multiple local and global networks serving private, public, business, academic, and government purposes. It allows for the exchange of data between more than a hundred Internet-linked countries worldwide. This makes the Internet an enormous carrier of various information resources and services. Some of these include text and multi-media data, email, online chat, VoIP, file transfer and file sharing, ecommerce, and online gaming.

#### Wireless Networks

Wireless networks are those computer networks that use electromagnetic waves instead of wires in order to carry signals over the various parts of the network. Wireless networks can be described as PANs, LANs or WANs, depending on their scope.

Because browsing the Internet is considered a normal daily activity, wireless access points have become common place in the communication infrastructure today. Public Internet-connected places include libraries, airports, coffee shops, hotels, and specialized Internet cafes. Thanks to Wi-Fi technology, the Internet can now be accessed by every person with a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

|Type|Range|Standards|
|----|-----|---------|
|PAN|Within reach of a person|Bluetooth, ZigBee, NFC|
|LAN|With a building or campus|IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)|
|MAN|Within a city|IEEE 802.15 (WiMAX)|
|WAN|Worldwide|Cellular (UMTs, LTE, ...)|


#### The Cloud

The term “cloud” is used in many different ways. The cloud is not as much a type of network as it is a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers that are used to store and analyze data, provide access to on-line applications, and provide backup services for personal and corporate use (Figure 5). Cloud services are provided by different organizations.

#### The Edge

The edge refers to the physical “edge” of a corporate network.

#### Fog Computing

With the rising number of sensors used by the Internet of Things, there is often a need to store the sensor data securely and closer to where the data can be analyzed. This analyzed data can then be used quickly and effectively to update or modify processes within the organization. The fog is located at the edge of a business or corporate network. Servers and computer programs allow the data to be pre-processed for immediate use. Then the pre-processed  data can be sent to the cloud for more in-depth computing if required.

### What is IoT?

#### How are IoT Devices Connected to the Network?

A sensor needs to be connected to a network so that the gathered data can be stored and shared. This requires either a wired Ethernet connection or a wireless connection to a controller. Controllers are responsible for collecting data from sensors and providing network or Internet connectivity. Controllers may have the ability to make immediate decisions, or they may send data to a more powerful computer for analysis. This more powerful computer might be in the same LAN as the controller or might only be accessible through an Internet connection.

Sensors often work together with a device called an actuator. Actuators take electrical input and transform the input into physical action. As an example, if a sensor detects excess heat in a room, the sensor sends the temperature reading to the microcontroller. The microcontroller can send the data to an actuator which would then turn on the air conditioner.

The majority of new devices such as fitness wearables, implanted pacemakers, air meters in a mine shaft, and water meters in a farm field all require wireless connectivity. Because many sensors are “out in the field” and are powered by batteries or solar panels, consideration must be given to power consumption. Low-powered connection options must be used to optimize and extend the availability of the sensor.

## Everything becomes programmable

### Flowcharts

Flowcharts are used in many industries including engineering, physical sciences, and computer programming where a complete understanding of processes or workflows is required. Flowcharts are diagrams that are used to represent these processes or workflows. Flowcharts illustrate how a process should work. Flowcharts should not require complex, industry-specific terminology or symbols. A flowchart should be easy to understand without having to be an expert in the chosen field. Flowcharts should show input states, any decisions made, and the results of those decisions. It is important to show the steps that should be taken when the result of a decision is either yes or no. It is common for programmers to create a first draft of a program in no specific programming language. These language-independent programs are focused on the logic rather than in the syntax and are often called algorithms. A flowchart is a common way to represent an algorithm. An example of a flowchart is shown in the figure.

### System Software, Application Software, and Computer Languages

There are two common types of computer software: system software and application software. Application software programs are created to accomplish a certain task or collection of tasks. For example, Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation program that allows users to model complex networks and ask “what if” questions about network behavior. System software works between the computer hardware and the application program. It is the system software that controls the computer hardware and allows the application programs to function. Common examples of system software include Linux, Apple OSX, and Microsoft Windows. Both system software and application software are created using a programming language. A programming language is a formal language designed to create programs that communicate instructions to computer hardware. These programs implement algorithms which are self-contained, step-by-step sets of operations to be performed.

Some computer languages compile their programs into a set of machine-language instructions. C++ is an example of a compiled computer language. Others interpret these instructions directly without first compiling them into machine language. Python is an example of an interpreted programming language. An example of Python code is shown in the figure. When the programming language is determined and the process is diagrammed in a flowchart, program creation can begin. Most computer languages use similar program structures.
