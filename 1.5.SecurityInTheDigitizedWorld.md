# Security in the Digitized World

## Why is Security so Important?

### Types of Data

Has data really changed? Well technically no, data generated by computers and digital devices is still groups of 1s and 0s. That has not changed. What has changed is the quantity, volume, variety, and immediacy of the generated data. 

Historically companies would have access to our information gathered from forms, spreadsheets, applications, credit card purchases and other types of files. Much of the information was stored and analyzed at a later date. Sensitive data was still collected, stored and analyzed but, historically, hackers were more interested in hacking into systems to obtain corporate or government secrets. Today, gathered data is taking on new characteristics. The digitized world has opened the floodgates for data gathering. IoT sensor-enabled devices are collecting more and more data of a personal nature. Wearable fitness trackers, home monitoring systems, security cameras, and debit card transactions are all collecting personal data as well as business and environmental data. Data is often combined from different sources and users may be unaware of this. Combining fitness monitoring data with house monitoring data could produce data points to help map the movements or location of a homeowner. This changing type of data collection and aggregation can be used for good purposes to help the environment. It also increases the possibility of invasion of our privacy, identity theft, and corporate espionage.

Personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal information (SPI) is any data relating to a living individual that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual. The data gathered by companies and government institutions can also contain sensitive information concerning corporate secrets, new product patents, or national security.

Because we are gathering and storing exponential quantities of both sensitive and informational data, it has increased the need for extra security to protect this information from natural disasters, hackers, and misuse.

Personal Identifiable Information: social security number, email address, bank account numbers, student tuition bill, credit rating, debit card number, fingerprints, birth date, username/password, vehicle identification number, mortgage information, home address, facebook photographs;

Informational: rain gauge value, number of cars through an intersection, hospital emergency use per state, average plane capacity, house thermometer reading, census data, immigration values, average potato crops per province, next train time per station, average gas consumption per flight.

### Security Best Practices

1. Perform Risk Assessment: knowing the value of what you are protecting will help in justifying security expenditures;

2. Create a Security Policy: create a policy that clearly outlines company rules, job duties, and expectations.

3. Physical Security Measures: Restrict access to network assets in networking closets and server locations. Install appropriate fire suppression systems

4. Human Resource Security Measures: Employees should be properly researched with background checks.

5. Perform and Test Backups: Perform regular backups and test data recovery from backups

6. Maintain Security Patches and Updates: Regularly update server, client, and network device operating systems and programs

7. Employ Access Controls: Configure user roles and privilege levels as well as strong user authentication

8. Regularly Test Incident Response: Employ an incident response team and test emergency response scenarions

9. Implement a Network Monitoring, Analytics and Management Tool: Choose a security monitoring solution that integrates with other technologies

10. Implement Network Security Devices: Use next generation routers, firewalls, and other security appliances

11. Implement a Comprehensive Endpoint Security Solution: Use enterprise level antimalware and antivirus software

12. Educate Users: Educate users and employees in secure procedures

13. Encrypt data: encrypt all sensitive company data including email.

### Challenges of Securing IoT devices

IoT devices are developed with the necessary network connectivity capabilities but often do not implement strong network security. Network security is a critical factor when deploying IoT devices. Methods must be taken to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and security of the data, the path from the sensor to the collector, and the connectivity to the device.

Factors that impact network security in the IoT can be:

1. The number os interconnected sensors and smart devices is growing exponentially, increasing the opportunity for attacks. Sensors and smart devices tend to be small devices, with varying OS, CPU types, and memory. Many of these entities are expected to be inexpensive, single-function devices with rudimentary network connectivity
2. Some connected IoT devices are able to interact with the physical world. They are now located in appliances, in automobiles, on or in our bodies, and in our homes. They could also be located in city lampposts or attacked to tree trunks. These non-traditional locations make physical security difficult or impossible to achieve. The devices should be manufactured to be resistant to tampering, and they should be placed so that they are not obvious and are very difficult to access.Safe Wi-Fi Usage
3. IoT sensor-enabled devices may be located in remote and/or inaccessible locations where human intervention or configuration is almost impossible. The devices are often designed to be in service many years longer than is typical for conventional high-tech equipment. Some IoT devices are intentionally designed without the ability to be upgraded, or they might be deployed in situations that make it difficult or impossible to reconfigure or upgrade. New vulnerabilities are uncovered all of the time. If a device is non-upgradeable, then the vulnerability will exist for the rest of its lifetime. If a device is upgradable, the typical consumer may not have a technology background, therefore, the upgrade process should perform automatically or be easy enough to be performed by a layperson.

### Safe Wi-Fi Usage

1. Change the default administrator password using a strong and unique password
2. Change the network service set identifier (SSID)
3. Do not advertise the SSID name
4. Create a Guest Wireless Network
5. Enable the built-in firewall
6. Configure the wireless router to use WPA2-AES encryption
7. Keep the wireless router's firmware updated
8. Use Media Access Control (MAC) Address Filtering
9. Disable your wireless router's remote management feature
10. Physically secure the wireless router

## Securing Personal Data and Devices

### Smart Homes

Smart home technology has become very popular and its popularity is increasing every year as the technology evolves. Who doesn’t find it appealing to turn your home thermostat up or down while you are at work, or to have your refrigerator order groceries to be delivered when you get home? How cool is it to check on the dog or to verify that your teenagers are doing their homework after school by activating your home security cameras?

As we install more and more smart sensors into our homes, we do increase the potential for security issues. Often the sensors are connected to the same network as our home or small business devices so that a breach of one device can radiate outwards to affect all connected devices. The sensors could also provide a way for hackers to get into our home network and gain access to any PCs and data that are connected to it.

Even virtual assistants such as Apple SIRI, Amazon Echo, or Google Home can be security risks. People use these devices to turn on music, adjust room temperatures, order products on-line, and get directions for where they are going. Can this cause any harm? It is possible that personal information such as passwords or credit card information could be leaked.

Fortunately many of the security flaws of the early smart technology sensors have already been discovered. Developers are working to correct the flaws and improve security measures to protect their systems from attack. Before purchasing home security systems, it is very important to research the developer and the security and encryption protocols that are in place for its products.

### Public Hotspots

When you are away from home, a public Wi-Fi hot spot allows you to access your online information and surf the Internet. Common activities on public Wi-Fi include logging into a personal email account, entering personally identifiable information, logging into social media, and accessing bank or financial information. All of this information could be stolen if the Wi-Fi connection is unsecure.

Safety rules to follow if you are using a public or unsecure Wi-Fi hotspot:

Do not access or send any sensitive personal information over a public wireless network.
Verify whether your computer is configured with file and media sharing, and that it requires user authentication with encryption.
Use encrypted virtual private network (VPN) tunnels and services. The VPN service provides you secure access to the Internet, with an encrypted connection between your computer and the VPN service provider’s VPN server. With an encrypted VPN tunnel, even if a data transmission is intercepted, it is not decipherable.
Many mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, come with the Bluetooth wireless protocol. This capability allows Bluetooth-enabled devices to connect to each other and share information. Unfortunately, Bluetooth can be exploited by hackers to eavesdrop on some devices, establish remote access controls, distribute malware, and drain batteries. To avoid these issues, keep Bluetooth turned off when you are not using it.
